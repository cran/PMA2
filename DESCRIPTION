Description: A modified version of PMA. The CCA() and CCA.permute() functions can also compute the
	component-wise standard deviations of estimated U and V through 
	permutations in addition to standardize them. Furthermore, it computes 
	the non-parametric p-values for each components. 
	Performs Penalized Multivariate Analysis: a penalized matrix decomposition, sparse principal 	
	components analysis, and sparse canonical correlation analysis, described in
